## 🤔 Why is the root build command so weird?

I am using [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/alexbarker234/alexbarker234.github.io) to host the game, so I need to:
1. Install both server & client dependencies
2. Build the client application
3. Copy the build folder to the root directory for main GitHub actions to manage
